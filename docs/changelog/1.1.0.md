# Changes in v1.1

## Transition to pure BuildKit API

In v1.1 BrewKit use Buildkit gRPC API for building vertexes and calculating vars.
This means for the end user:
* Faster builds - due to excluding unnecessary local FS scan from buildkit (see `Changes in behaviour`)
* Clear process of calculating vars
* More laconic output from building(no more kilos of duplicated logs)

For brewkit internals means:
* Full control for llb generation without Dockerfile limitations
* Control of output and logs
* More easy and smooth future implementation Docker images building

## BrewKit build-definition apiVersion

Now actual BrewKit build-definition is `brewkit/v2` due to breaking changes in behaviour. (see `Changes in behaviour`)
New futures like network host or multiple outputs - are unavailable for `brewkit/v1`.
ApiVersion `brewkit/v1` just supported for backward compatibility and more smooth transition into `brewkit/v2`.
For now `brewkit/v1` is deprecated, will be removed in future versions.
Some further news futures that described below are not available or limited for `brewkit/v1`

## Changes in behaviour

For apiVersion = `brewkit/v2` used new internal implementation which uses pure BuildKit API and further will be primary
for building. 
New implementation **exports artifacts only from full build completion**.
Which means targets cannot rely on changes from other targets on local filesystem, since until **build is not completed - nothing exported into local filesystem**.

## Private targets

Define private targets with prefix `_` for ex. `_gobuild`.
Private unavailable for direct execution via `brewkit build`, only for internal use in build-definition 

## CLI

Changes in brewkit cli

## Autocompletion

Generate autocompletion for:

bash
```shell
brewkit completion bash
```

zsh
```shell
brewkit completion zsh
```

### Define build context

You can define build context with `brewkit build -c src`

### Short notation for build command

To run build you can use short command
```shell
brewkit b
```

Works like `brewkit build` but without nested command to manage build-definition 
which easier to use with autocompletion

### Define progress mode

Several progress modes available:

| Name    | Description                                |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| AUTO    | Automatically detect suitable progressmode |
| TTY     | Interactive progressmode                   |
| Plain   | Plain logs                                 |
| rawjson | Outputs buidlkit vertexes in JSON format   |
| quiet   | Suppress all output                        |


```shell
tty - default
```
